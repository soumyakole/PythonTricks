"""Different techniques to flatten deeply nested data structures
"""

# Using genetaror
# yield from effectively delegates the iteration process to an outer iteration.
# yield from is especially useful when writing code that must recursively iterate through nested iterables.
# Limitation -it is still subject to Pythonâ€™s recursion limit, so it would not be able to handle deeply nested structures.
